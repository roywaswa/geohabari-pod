      <p>
        Geospatial technology is everywhere — powering the apps we use, the cities we live in, the farms we depend on, and the decisions that shape our future. But too often, it feels distant, overly technical, or out of reach. Geohabari was created to change that.

          We exist to demystify geospatial technology — to break it down, open it up, and let it speak in everyday language. But more than that, we&apos;re here to spotlight African innovation — the thinkers, builders, mappers, and dreamers who are solving real-world problems with homegrown solutions.
